    <h5> 8/8/23 - Team Allison and Nahum Zak
      <ol>
        <li>This day is a godSand <br>
            Pack your bags and leave your AirBNB for good. Per our discussion, and your choice, you are headed to the Great Sand Dunes National Park where you will see the tallest Dunes in the Americas. <br>

            With regard to timing this is your day to carve out. Dogs are allowed on a leash. Your pass allows you 24 hour entry. Sunscreen is a must and you will need to submit 10 pictures. Night time star gazing is recommended. There are few places on Earth high enough above the light pollution of the cities that see a sky like this.<br>

            Extra points if the two of you are uniquely (you choose the style) dressed in any of the photos. <br>

            <strong><u>Important Notes:</u></strong> The sand reaches 150 degrees in the height of the day so you would be advised to hike on sand either early or later in the day. The trails and lakes should be lovely all day for you. The weather can vary however so wearing multiple layers, that can be removed, is advised. Bring plenty of food and water. Also bring doggy shoes if you have them. <br>
            You will receive points for photos of:
            <ul>
              <li>Postcard Photos</li>
              <li>Starry Nights (Sunset is 8:05 PM)</li>
